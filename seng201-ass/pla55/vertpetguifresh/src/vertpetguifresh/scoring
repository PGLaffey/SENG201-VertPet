Score:
At the end of the game a player will be rewarded points for how well they have played. They can earn points a number of different ways.
The ways a player can earn points are:
Pet Score - The overall pets health and happiness will determine the score for a pet with a max value of 10,000. If a pet dies it will count as -5,000 points towards the players total score. A player will earn a score for every pet they own.
Money Score - A player will earn 10 points for every $1 they have at the end of the game. Any food or toys a player has will be sold for 75% of their original value.
